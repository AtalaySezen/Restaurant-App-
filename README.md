<h1>Hello, This is my Restaurant App Project</h1>
<p>In this project, I used HTML5, Javascript, Json-Server, CSS and bootstrap in the admin panel as technology.</p>
<p>I made general page designs based on an example I saw in figma.Absolutely mobile friendly</p>
<p>I used random user api for user profile pictures on the homepage.</p>
<a href="https://randomuser.me/">Link for random user api</a>

<p>On the other page, the food page(Yemek Listemiz in Turkish), I used the meal api.</p>
