<h1>Hello, this is my Restaurant App project</h1>
<p>Restaurant application made for HTTP request work. I used api in many places throughout the application. Forms sent on the reservation page in the application are registered on the admin page. Customers who have made a reservation can be reached through the admin page, and also a search can be made on the db.json file. You can see the admin page link and the technologies I use in the rest of the article.</p>

<p>In this project, I used HTML5, Javascript, Json-Server, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
<p>I made general page designs based on an example I saw in figma. Absolutely mobile friendly.</p>
<h1>What did I use in the project?</h1>
<p>I used AOS Library for animations  on the whole pages.</p>

<p>I used SwiperJS for slider on the homepage.</p>
<a href="https://swiperjs.com/">Link for SwiperJS</a>
<p>I used random user api for user profile pictures on the homepage.</p>
<a href="https://randomuser.me/">Link for random user api</a>
<p>On the other page, the food page(Yemek Listemiz in Turkish), I used the meal api.</p>
<a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">Link for meal api</a> 
<p>There is a search feature in the meal api.</p>
<p>On the other page, the reservation page(Rezervasyon in Turkish), I used the json-server for saving form data.</p>
<p>When the reservation is made, the customer information is registered to the json-server.</p>

<p>On the other page, the Contact page(İletişim in Turkish), I used the Leatlefjs for map.</p>

<h1>Admin Panel</h1>
<p>For this panel, I can't exactly call it the admin panel. Because we cannot change the content and images on the homepage and other pages in any way.</p>
<p>In here I fetch datas from the Json-server. Extra feature user can search the customer who made reservation.</p>
<p>I made this panel only for the follow-up of the customers who made reservations.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Username:Admin </b></p>
<p><b>Password:12345</b></p>


<p>In addition, I made a login page for the admin page. When the admin logs in on the login page, it registers to localStorage as a boolean true. Afterwards, when you log out, localStorage is cleared.</p>
<p>If the admin is not logged in, the admin panel cannot login to the page, it is directed directly to the homepage.</p>
